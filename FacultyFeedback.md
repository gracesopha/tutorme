# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

- Problem statements could use some clarification "campus community member" versus "student" or "instruction. Not enought differentiation / difference between different
  personas.  Each person should have a different problem you are solving.

- Next week each person should present the individual work item they completed and the work item they are working on this week. Filter Kanban board
by icon so only one person's work is showing

- Too many team members on one story ("mobbing"). Each person should have their own work item / story they are working on each week. In order to get the velocity
you need, with mobbing you would have to finish one work item every 30 minutes of class. That is why you have to work in parallel
