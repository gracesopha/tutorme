# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 2 - Jan 18 ##

## Week 3 - Jan 25 ##

## Week 4 - Feb 1 ##
- Good product design document
- Your backlog needs to have at least two weeks worth of stories so you know what comes next ie:ten work items/stories

## Week 5 - Feb 8 ##
 - You are mobbing too much and it slows you down. Each person should have a story that they own and are working on each week.
## Week 6 - Feb 15 ##

- Use the default work item numbers. You do not need to make up a story number in the title

## Week 7 - Feb 22 ##
- Each work item / user story should have detailed description and acceptance criteria/checklist so you know what "done" looks like. Lots of team members
are missing acceptance criteria. Work item descriptions are the "what".  Acceptance criteria should include tests and other proof, plus final actions such as "push"
to repro", update documentation, etc.
